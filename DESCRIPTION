Description: Integrates population dynamics and dispersal into a
    mechanistic virtual species simulator. The package can be used to
    study the effects of environmental change on population growth and
    range shifts. It allows for simple and straightforward definition of
    population dynamics (including positive density dependence), extensive
    possibilities for defining dispersal kernels, and the ability to
    generate virtual ecologist data. Learn more about the 'rangr' at
