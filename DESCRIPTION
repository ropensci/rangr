Description: Integrates population dynamics and dispersal into a mechanistic 
  virtual species simulator. The package can be used to study the effects of 
  environmental change on population growth and range shifts. It allows for 
  simple and straightforward definition of population dynamics (including 
  positive density dependence), extensive possibilities for defining dispersal 
  kernels, and the ability to generate virtual ecologist data. Learn more about 
  the 'rangr' at <https://docs.ropensci.org/rangr/>.
